    #[SPRITES: Shina (Neutral)– Location: Far right] 
    n "Shina sat on her throne, mindlessly going through scroll after scroll of requests and complaints from the people of the Moon Kingdom."
    n "The people of the upper city had put in a request to raise the walls that separated them from the lower city, while the merchants in the lower city wanted more territory."
    n "The only problem with the second request was that if Shina expanded the lower city’s borders, it would push them into the upper city or the dangers of the Forest of Lilth."
    n "Shina sighed heavily and tapped her fingers on her lips, considering a good compromise that would make everyone happy."
    n "After a moment, the plan came to her."
    
    #[SFX: FINGER SNAP] 
    n "With a snap of her fingers, a roll of parchment appeared open and floating midair. Shina began speaking aloud."
    n "As she did, beautiful cursive appeared on the page."

    sh "To my most loyal subjects, after much thought and deliberation, I have come to a decision that I believe will please all parties involved."
    sh "The walls of the upper city will be raised as requested, but there will be sentries placed atop the perimeter of the wall in order to keep the peace."
    sh "As for the expansion of the lower city, the walls of my kingdom will be pushed inward to accommodate you."
    sh "Construction of both of these projects will start tomorrow morning."
    sh "I will personally oversee these projects in order to insure you are all happy."
 
    sh "Best regards, Shina."

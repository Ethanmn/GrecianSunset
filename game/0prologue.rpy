    n "Shina sat on her throne, mindlessly going through scroll after scroll of requests and complaints from the people of the Moon Kingdom."
    n "The people of the upper city had put in a request to raise the walls that separated them from the lower city, while the merchants in the lower city wanted more territory."
    n "The only problem with the second request was that if Shina expanded the lower city’s borders, it would push them into the upper city or the dangers of the Forest of Lilth."
    n "Shina sighed heavily and tapped her fingers on her lips, considering a good compromise that would make everyone happy."
    n "After a moment, the plan came to her."

    n "With a snap of her fingers, a roll of parchment appeared open and floating midair. Shina began speaking aloud."
    n "As she did, beautiful cursive appeared on the page."
